## Final Reflections

### What We Completed
We successfully leveraged multiple APIs to gather data pertaining to video games, generated sentiment from the data gathered, stored this in MongoDB, and displayed the stored metadata about the games along with the generated sentiments on a locally hosted page.

### What We Had Planned
We intended to display specific comments on the page that scored very high or low in sentiment. We also planned to create a feature that would auto-create pages for new games queried (with available listings on IGDB) to gradually build a library.

### Bugs?
As of now, everything works as intended, and there are no known bugs in the current features.

### Hosting Site
We did not create a public hosting site.
